# Bingo

AIM OF THE PROJECT : 

The goal of this project is to develop a Java application that creates a tombola card. A tombola card is a card containing 15 random numbers in a 3x9 matrix. In this project, random number generation is the ordering of the numbers on the card and 

checks whether the drawn tiles match the numbers on the cards. Each time the take number button is pressed, a tile will be drawn and this tile will appear on the side. This button also determines the game winner.
